							<p>Healthcheckins is a social media web app for patients of certain medical conditions, such as Diabetes or Cancer, to connect with other patients and mentors.</p>
							<p>I built Healthcheckins from the ground-up on Rails. It features Facebook-type group interactions, hashtags, profile pages, and mentor and admin dashboards that show detailed group rankings and user data.</p>
							<p>Healthcheckins is still undergoing development and testing and should be launched later this year, 2017.</p>

						<p>Stick To It is built to assist with a research project for UCLA and UC Berkeley. The app uses gamification through Buzzfeed-style quizzes to encourage patients to be informed about their sexual health, as well as earned points the user can redeem for prizes when getting tested for HIV/STD's at participating clinics.</p>
						<p>We built the app in Rails and features a main dashboard, a quiz page, user settings page, a point system, and public splash page.</p>

							<p>Built in Rails, ReactJS, and uses RSpec for testing.</p>

							<div class="product-title">Marcarelli Design</div>
							<p>Marcarelli Design was one of my first projects as a developer. The website needed a few minor styling updates and they wanted a custom thumbnail navigation bar on the front page, which I implemented. I also added a lazy loading feature to the full screen slider, so the client could add more photos without slowing down the initial page load. Everything I added was completely custom and hand-coded.</p>

						<p>I worked on the CSUN Jazz page as a revamp of their original page, which was non-responsive. We added the full screen slider on the main page and kept it true to its original while updating the code to current standards and making it fully responsive.</p>
						<p>CSUN Jazz is a custom WordPress theme and the fullscreen slider is a fully custom plugin which we used from the Marcarelli Design website.</p>

							<p>The website is built in WordPress and is built so the client can customize the content. It's a completely custom theme, handcoded, and fully responsive. The top slider and the movie credits are custom plugins built by Electronic Methods, which I very slightly tweaked to fit NonStop's needs.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Skills</h2>
				<div class="skill-desc-container">
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="html">
						<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
						<p>I am fluent in markup and styling and use them almost on a daily basis. I am accustomed to hand-coding all of my markup/styling, which gives me a deep understanding on how to use both most efficiently, and properly. I'm also comfortable using SCSS syntax, which I have mostly used alongside Rails.</p>
						<p>I also enjoy using CSS for animations. For this, depending on the situation, I'll either write animations in CSS or I'll use the TransitJS JavaScript library to add them with event listeners and such.</p>
						<p>Although I have worked a bit with the Bootstrap framework (mostly for building backend dashboards), I take pride that I can build everything from scratch and understand how things work.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="js">
						<h3>JavaScript/ES6</h3>
						<p>My most comfortable language is JavaScript. I can navigate/manipulate the DOM as well as create more complex features.</p>
						<p>The most complex JavaScript application I've worked on was an Android, web wrapper app, where the entire app was written in HTML/CSS and one main script file. It included screen changes/animations, a back button, communicating with an API for dynamically inserted data, an interactive map, and many more features built primarily in JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
						<p>I'm also familiar with ES6 syntax, mostly through using ReactJS with Webpack.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="jquery">
						<h3>jQuery/Ajax</h3>
						<p>As well as using vanilla JavaScript, I also utilize jQuery. I prefer manipulating and navigating the DOM through jQuery as well as using it to listen for events. </p>
						<p>At the same time, I'm familiar with best practices using jQuery - such as grabbing and saving elements as needed (rather than repeatedly grabbing), which speeds up the application.</p>
						<p>I'm also great with using Ajax with jQuery, which is how I primarily use Ajax. I've worked with applications using jQuery Ajax for API calls as well as calls to controllers in an MVC environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="rails">
						<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
						<p>I can build a Rails application ground-up very comfortably, as well as write in Ruby. I'm comfortable with MVC, communicating between controllers and views, creating table associations and working with data, and understand how Rails works as a whole.</p>
						<p>I have also built a few small API's and one API for a mobile app using ActiveModelSerializers.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="wp">
						<h3>Wordpress</h3>
						<p>I have built custom Wordpress templates and know the general ins and outs of Wordpress theme development. I've also worked with a handful of custom plugins and have tweaked them as needed. Though PHP is not something I work with regularly, I understand how to use the basics with Wordpress.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="git">
						<h3>Git Version Control</h3>
						<p>Pretty self explanatory - I use Git and Github both professionally and personally. I've worked in a team setting with Git and regularly commit my personal learning and side projects.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="rd">
						<h3>Responsive Design and Browser Compatibility</h3>
						<p>All apps and websites I build are handcoded fully responsive (without the use of frameworks such as Bootstrap) and look great on every screen size, down to the size of an iPhone 5.</p>
						<p>I also am aware of browser compatibility issues and make websites and apps compatible down to IE9.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="dynamic">
						<h3>Dynamic Websites/Apps</h3>
						<p>I really love making dynamic apps and websites. I've worked (mostly) in Rails to accomplish this and use a combination of Ajax requests to controllers as well as sending partials through Rails. Most recently I've been working in React and plan to use it moreso in the future.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="webpack">
						<h3>Webpack2</h3>
						<p>I'm familiar with Webpack and have been working with it through JavaScript. Though I'm not an expert yet, I plan on getting there in the near future. Check back with me on it in a month or so :)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="react">
						<h3>ReactJS</h3>
						<p>I am familiar with the basics of React and having been building personal projects in order to become more familiar. Right now I'm building a color matching game with Webpack2 and React, which you can view on my Github. Check back with me in a month :)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="java">
						<h3>Java</h3>
						<p>Eventually I want to be really great at Java. I'm still in the learning process and can debug and build small projects. You can view some of my learning projects on my Github. Check back with me on it in a year :)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" data-desc="ps">
						<h3>PhotoShop</h3>
						<p>I am comfortable with using PhotoShop for basic manipulations as well as working from mock-up files for websites. I am pixel perfect and enjoy using PhotoShop to make sure my websites fit the client's design, exactly.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="skill-desc" id="toolbox-desc" data-desc="toolbox">
						<h3>My Toolbox</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>I work primarily on Mac (and prefer it), but am comfortable with PC as well. </li>
							<li>I also primarily use Sublime as a text editor and to edit through FTP. For file transfers to the server I use Filezilla.</li>
							<li>When building Rails apps I generally use Vagrant and Virtual box.</li>
							<li>For Wordpress, I use MAMP.</li>
							<li>When I'm working with Java, I use Eclipse.</li>
